<p> This is a beginner's guide to building accessible web application. More specifically, this is guide a to building websites in a way that individuals with disabilities (such as visual, physical or neurological) are be able to understand, interact and contribute to your website just as easily as a normal person can. If you are a web developer looking to create accessible websites and dont know where to start, this is the right place. </p> <p> It might surprise you that you can browse this page with your eyes closed! Applications called screen readers are meant to do just that. <a href="http://www.chromevox.com/">ChromeVox</a> is one such (free) plugin for Google Chrome browser. Screen readers use a combination of keyboard input and text-to-speech to aid visually impaired users browse the web. So imagine you type in the url, and screen reader starts reading out the content. When you press <code>Tab</code> it reads out the first actionable link on the page and when you hit <code>Enter</code> it opens that link. Of course browsing a page can be way more complex than that and unfortunately most of the websites are not designed to be compatible with screen readers. But if you design your website in a way that will help screen reader do its job then you can enable a visually impaired user do exactly as much as a normal user can. </p> <p> Tools that help individuals with disabilities to interact with web applications are termed as Assistive Technology (AT). </p> <div> ATs include tools like <ul> <li> <b>Wands and sticks</b> worn on the head, held in the mouth or strapped to the chin and used to press keys on the keyboard </li> <li> <b>Screen readers</b> are used to verbalize, or "speak," everything on the screen including text, graphics, control buttons, and menus into a computerized voice that is spoken aloud </li> <li> <b>Screen magnifiers</b> work like a magnifying glass for the computer by enlarging a portion of the screen which can increase legibility and make it easier to see items on the computer </li> </ul> </div> <p> Much like how <a href="http://www.w3.org/">W3C</a> defined HTML5 to standardise HTML markup, Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/" target="_blank">WCAG</a>) defines guidelines to make web applications accessible. Which means that developers need to follow these guidelines in order to make their websites compatible with ATs. The aim of this guide is not to decrypt the myriad list of WCAG guidelines but to inspire developers with the philosophy behind it. In order to program websites that are compliant with WCAG you will needs to make a paradigm shift, just like jQuery to Angularjs or non-functional to functional programing. The following section will help you make that paradigm shift. </p> <section class="table-of-content"> <h1>Content</h1> <ul> <li ng-repeat="c in content"> <a href="#{{c.title | idfy}}" onclick="return false" ng-click="scrollTo($event)" ng-bind="c.title"></a> <ul> <li ng-repeat="s in c.subTitles"> <a href="#{{s.title | idfy}}" onclick="return false" ng-click="scrollTo($event)" ng-bind="s.title"></a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </section> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-12"> <section ng-repeat="c in content" resource="#{{c.title | idfy}}" id="{{c.title | idfy}}"> <h2 ng-bind="c.title"></h2> <div ng-include="c.partial" ng-if="c.partial"></div> <p ng-bind="c.title" ng-if="!c.partial"></p> <section ng-repeat="s in c.subTitles" resource="#{{s.title | idfy}}" id="{{s.title | idfy}}" class="sub-section"> <h3 ng-bind="s.title"></h3> <p ng-bind="s.title" ng-if="!s.partial"></p> <div ng-include="s.partial" ng-if="s.partial"></div> </section> </section> </div> </div>
