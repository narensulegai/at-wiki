<p> This is a beginner's guide to design and build accessible web application. More specifically, this is a guide to help you build websites in a way that people with disabilities (such as visual, physical or neurological) are be able to understand, interact and contribute just as easily as a normal person can. </p> <p> It might be mildly surprising that you can browse this page with your eyes closed right now! Applications, called screen readers are meant to do just that. <a href="http://www.chromevox.com/">ChromeVox</a> is one such (free) plugin for Google Chrome browser. Screen readers use a combination of keyboard and text to speech to aid visually impaired users browse the web. So imagine you type in the url of a page and when the page is loaded the screen reader starts reading out the content and when you press <code>Tab</code> it reads out the first actionable link on the page and when you hit <code>Enter</code> it opens that link. Of course browsing a page can be way more complex than that and unfortunately most of the websites are not designed to be compatible with screen readers.. But if you design your website in a way that will help the screen readers do their job then you can enable a visually impaired user do exactly as much as a normal user can. </p> <p> Tools that help individuals with disabilities to browse the web are termed as Assistive Technology (AT). </p> <div> ATs include tools like <ul> <li> <b>Wands and sticks</b> worn on the head, held in the mouth or strapped to the chin and used to press keys on the keyboard </li> <li> <b>Screen readers</b> are used to verbalize, or "speak," everything on the screen including text, graphics, control buttons, and menus into a computerized voice that is spoken aloud </li> <li> <b>Screen magnifiers</b> work like a magnifying glass for the computer by enlarging a portion of the screen which can increase legibility and make it easier to see items on the computer </li> </ul> </div> <p> Much like how W3C defined HTML5 to standardise HTML markup, Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">WCAG</a>) defined guidelines to make web applications more accessible. Which means that a developer who want to make his website usable via ATs have to follow these guidelines. The aim of this guide is not to decrypt the plethora of WCAG guidelines but to inspire developers with the philosophy behind it. In order to program websites that are compliant with WCAG you will needs to make a paradigm shift, just like jQuery to Angularjs or non-functional to functional programing. The following section is designed to help you make that paradigm shift with a list of live examples and code snippets which will help you in looking <i>through an AT's eye</i>. </p> <section class="table-of-content"> <h1>Content</h1> <ul> <li ng-repeat="c in content"> <a href="#{{c.title | idfy}}" onclick="return false" ng-click="scrollTo($event)" ng-bind="c.title"></a> <ul> <li ng-repeat="sub in c.subTitles"> <a href="#{{sub.title | idfy}}" onclick="return false" ng-click="scrollTo($event)" ng-bind="sub.title"></a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </section> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-12"> <section ng-repeat="c in content" resource="#{{c.title | idfy}}" id="{{c.title | idfy}}"> <h2 ng-bind="c.title"></h2> <p ng-bind="c.title"></p> <section ng-repeat="sub in c.subTitles" resource="#{{sub.tile | idfy}}" id="{{sub.title | idfy}}"> <h3 ng-bind="sub.title"></h3> <p ng-bind="sub.title"></p> </section> </section> </div> </div>
