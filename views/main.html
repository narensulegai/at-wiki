<p> This is a beginner's guide to building accessible web application. More specifically, this is guide a to building websites in a way that individuals with disabilities (such as visual, physical or neurological) are be able to understand, interact and contribute to your website just as easily as a normal person can. If you are a web developer looking to create accessible websites and dont know where to start, this is the right place. </p> <p> Tools that help individuals with disabilities are broadly termed as Assistive Technology (AT). ATs that help disabled users browse the web include: </p> <div> <ul> <li> <b>Wands and sticks</b> worn on the head, held in the mouth or strapped to the chin and used to press keys on the keyboard </li> <li> <b>Screen readers</b> are used to verbalize, or "speak," everything on the screen including text, graphics, control buttons, and menus into a computerized voice that is spoken aloud. <a href="http://www.chromevox.com/">ChromeVox</a> is one such (free) plugin for Google Chrome browser, other popular screen readers include JAWS, NVDA etc </li> <li> <b>Screen magnifiers</b> work like a magnifying glass for the computer by enlarging a portion of the screen which can increase legibility and make it easier to see items on the computer </li> </ul> </div> <p> Much like how <a href="http://www.w3.org/">W3C</a> defined HTML5 markup, Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/" target="_blank">WCAG</a>) defines guidelines to make web applications accessible. Which means that developers need to follow these guidelines in order to make their websites compatible with ATs. If you design your website in a way that will help screen reader do its job then you can empower a visually impaired user do exactly as much as a normal user can. </p> <section class="table-of-content"> <h1>Content</h1> <ul> <li ng-repeat="c in content"> <a href="#{{c.title | idfy}}" onclick="return false" ng-click="scrollTo($event)" ng-bind="c.title"></a> <ul> <li ng-repeat="s in c.subTitles"> <a href="#{{s.title | idfy}}" onclick="return false" ng-click="scrollTo($event)" ng-bind="s.title"></a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </section> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-12"> <section ng-repeat="c in content" resource="#{{c.title | idfy}}" id="{{c.title | idfy}}"> <h2 ng-bind="c.title"></h2> <div ng-include="c.partial" ng-if="c.partial"></div> <p ng-bind="c.title" ng-if="!c.partial"></p> <section ng-repeat="s in c.subTitles" resource="#{{s.title | idfy}}" id="{{s.title | idfy}}" class="sub-section"> <h3 ng-bind="s.title"></h3> <p ng-bind="s.title" ng-if="!s.partial"></p> <div ng-include="s.partial" ng-if="s.partial"></div> </section> </section> </div> </div>
